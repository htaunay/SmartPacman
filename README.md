SmartPacman
===========

Who, where and why?
-------------------
Developed by: Henrique Taunay, game enthusiast
Student at PUC-Rio, who want's to get in the gamming business and just started taking it seriously

Description
-----------

Simple A* path-finding exercise, inspired by the classic game.
No game logic for now. SmartPacman basically loads a scene file and runs it. You move Pacman, and the Ghost go after you.

Building
--------

The game runs on XNA 4.0. I didn't bother posting the whole porject with all the garbage that comes with. Here you will find the source code and the contents (resources).
If you ever made a hello world project in XNA, you'll figure it out.

Running
-------

To run the game, you need a scene. Here, some scenes are inside 'contents/scenes'. When you run the game, put them in the 'Contents' folder, next to the generated binary. To load a specific scene, you still have to do it in code, but it is easy to find in the SmartPacMan class.
After you load the game with a valid scene, then its just ENTER to start/pause, and keyboard arrows to move.

Future
------
There lots of projects in my head, not sure if I will ever make this project more of a game, and less of a experiment. Time will tell.
